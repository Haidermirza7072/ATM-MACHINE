ATM Machine Java Project Description  

This is a simple ATM Machine project developed using Java. It is a console-based application that allows users to perform basic banking operations. The project is designed using the concept of object-oriented programming and does not use any database; all data is handled within the program itself.

The main features of the project include:

• Create Account – Users can create a new bank account by entering required details. Each account is given a unique account number.  
• Deposit Money – Users can deposit money into their account. The deposited amount is added to the current balance.  
• Withdraw Money – This feature allows users to withdraw money from their account. It also checks whether the user has enough balance before allowing the withdrawal.  
• Check Balance – Displays the current available balance in the user's account.  
• Transaction History – The application keeps a simple record of each deposit and withdrawal made by the user and displays it when requested
